About:
  This is a silly tui based RPG. The idea is to procedurally
  generate all monsters and items according to some simple
  rules. The player can choose an initial specialization,
  and then grind monsters to acquire better equipment.
  
  The long term idea is to incorporate more rpg elements,
  such as currency, unlocking abilities as you level up,
  and more detailed character customization and progression.

Setup:
  1. run configure script
  2. run build script
  3. drink espresso
  4. that's it
